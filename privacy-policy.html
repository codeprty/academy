        <p class="last-revised"><strong>Last revised: 28 March 2025</strong></p>

        <p class="intro">At BigDrop Academy, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your
          personal information. By using our website(s) (including <a href="https://www.bigdropacademy.com"
            target="_blank">www.bigdropacademy.com</a>), products,
          services, and applications (the “Services”), you agree to the practices outlined in this Privacy
          Policy. This means you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as
          described here.</p>

        <p class="intro">Your use of BigDrop Academy's Services is also governed by our <a
            href="terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>, which include this Privacy Policy. Any undefined
          terms in this Policy have the meanings provided in the Terms of Use.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains the information we collect when you access or use BigDrop Academy's
          Services, how we use and protect it, who we share it with, and your rights and controls over
          your data. We collect various types of information from users, which we use internally to
          personalize, provide, and improve our services, set up your account and profile, contact you,
          fulfill requests, and analyze how you use the Services. In some cases, we may share your
          information with third parties, but only with your consent, as outlined below.</p>

        <p class="strong-warning"><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.</strong> IT IS
          INCORPORATED INTO THE TERMS OF USE FOR BIGDROP ACADEMY AND FORMS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT
          BETWEEN YOU AND BIGDROP ACADEMY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE BIGDROP ACADEMY SERVICES, YOU AGREE
          TO THESE TERMS, WHICH WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT WHILE YOU USE THE SERVICES. THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL
          VISITORS, USERS, AND OTHERS WHO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF
          THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Will BigDrop Academy ever change this Privacy Policy?</h2>
        <p>As we continuously improve our Services, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
          This policy is effective as of the date listed above. If we make any material changes, we will
          notify you by posting a notice on our website and app or through other means as required by law.
          Continued use of the Services after changes are posted indicates your acceptance of those
          changes. Information we collect is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect when it is used.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What information does BigDrop Academy collect?</h2>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
        <p>We collect and store any information you voluntarily provide to us. For example, when you
          register or update your account settings, we may collect information like your name, age, email
          address, and third-party account credentials (such as your login details for Facebook or
          Google). If you provide these third-party credentials or sign in through a third-party site, you
          understand that some of your third-party account information (like your name and email) may be
          transmitted to us and will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Some information may be required
          to register or access certain features.</p>

        <p>We may also communicate with you if you've provided us with contact information. For instance, if
          you share your email address, we may send you promotional offers or notifications related to
          your use of our Services. We may also track when you open our emails to improve our
          communications. If you prefer not to receive marketing emails, you can unsubscribe by clicking
          the link in the email or by emailing us at <a
            href="mailto:data.privacy@bigdropacademy.com">data.privacy@bigdropacademy.com</a> with
          "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
        <p>When you interact with our Services, we automatically gather information from your browser or
          device, which may include your IP address, location, device ID, cookies, browser type, and the
          page or feature you accessed. Cookies are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that
          help us recognize your device and analyze how and when our Services are visited. You can adjust
          your browser settings to block cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to use some
          features.</p>

        <p>Our advertising partners may also use cookies when you click on ads, and third-party websites may
          place cookies on your device when you click on their links. We ensure that third parties placing
          ads or services through our platform follow proper data protection measures. However,
          third-party cookies may continue to track your activity even after you leave our Services. You
          can manage third-party cookies using the settings on your device.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">When using our AI features in courses or interacting with our AI
          chatbot:</h3>
        <p>Your content is shared with OpenAI, L.L.C. or its affiliates, who provide the AI technology. Be
          aware that any personal information included in your queries will be transmitted to OpenAI. Your
          use of these AI features is also governed by OpenAI's privacy policy and terms (<a
            href="https://openai.com/policies" target="_blank">https://openai.com/policies</a>).</p>

        <p>We use the automatically collected data to personalize content based on your usage and to improve
          our Services. For example, it helps us understand how often users interact with specific
          features, allowing us to enhance the overall experience.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Information Collected From Other Websites:</h2>
        <p>Through cookies placed on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online
          activity after you leave our Services. Similar to other usage data we collect, this helps us
          improve the Services, personalize your online experience, and for other purposes outlined in
          this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">How and Why BigDrop Academy Uses Your Personal Information:</h2>
        <p>We use your personal information only when we have a legitimate and appropriate reason to do so.
          For example, we may use your information to fulfill legal and regulatory obligations, provide
          the Services, respond to your requests, with your consent, or for our legitimate interests or
          those of third parties (such as for business or commercial purposes, as long as it doesn’t
          override your rights and interests).</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Is my Information secure?</h2>
        <p>Your account is protected by a password to ensure your privacy and security. If you access your
          account through a third-party site or service, additional sign-on protections may apply. It is
          your responsibility to prevent unauthorized access to your account by selecting a secure
          password and/or sign-on method, and by limiting access to your computer, device, and browser.
          Always sign off after using your account.</p>

        <p>At BigDrop Academy, we take your information security seriously and implement various technical
          measures to protect it. We use data anonymization and encryption where necessary, regularly
          review our procedures, restrict access to only the necessary employees, and ensure strict
          confidentiality and legitimate use of your data. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
          Unauthorized access, hardware or software failures, and other factors may affect the security of
          your information at any time.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Accessing, Managing, and Storing Your Personal Information:</h2>
        <p>You can access, update, or delete information like your name, email, and user profile through
          your account settings. You can also request to stop processing, transfer, or receive your data
          in a machine-readable format by emailing us at <a
            href="mailto:data.privacy@bigdropacademy.com">data.privacy@bigdropacademy.com</a>. While you
          can choose not to disclose certain information, some may be necessary to use our Services. You
          may also deactivate your account, but some information may remain in our records for legal or
          business purposes.</p>

        <p>Your personal information may be stored in the U.S., even if collected from other countries, and
          we ensure it complies with data protection laws. We retain your information as long as needed
          for the purpose it was collected, and in some cases, even after deactivation, to provide future
          services if you reactivate your account. Some data may still be available to others if shared,
          but we take steps to ensure your information remains secure and used appropriately.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">How to Contact Us:</h2>
